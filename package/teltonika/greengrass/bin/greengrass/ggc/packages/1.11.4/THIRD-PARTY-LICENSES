      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
      form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
      notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is
      provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
      that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
      revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
      as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
      License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
      from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
      Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
      version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for

      Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
      purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
      verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its

      conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
      owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
      behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
   Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
   this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
   import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
   those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
   infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
   Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
   If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
   Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
   patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
   License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
   filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
   in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
      copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
      from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
      a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
      file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
      Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
      NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
      Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
      Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
      NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
      License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
      that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
      the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
      construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
      provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
      reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
      Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
      distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
      this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
   Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
   any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
   herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
   you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except
   as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
   associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
   any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
   to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
   agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
   reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. END OF
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law)
or Public Domain Certification

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best of
his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of the
country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever
copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship identified below (the
"Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright
interest he may have in the associated work, and for these purposes, is
described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this
work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield him from
liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present
and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the
Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or
conceived.
